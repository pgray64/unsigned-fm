      <h2 class="mt-4"><b>UnsignedFM Terms of Service</b></h2>
      <h4 class="text-muted">Effective July 29, 2023</h4>
      <p>
        The UnsignedFM Terms of Service ("Terms") applies to your access to and
        use of the websites, mobile applications, widgets, and other online
        products and services (collectively, the "Services") provided by
        UnsignedFM, LLC ("UnsignedFM," "we," or "us").
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-2">1. Access to the Services</h3>
      <p>
        Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an account or
        otherwise use the Services. Additionally, you must be over the age
        required by the laws of your country, state, or locality to create an
        account or otherwise use the Services, or we need to have received
        verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of another legal entity,
        including a business or a government, you represent that you have full
        legal authority to bind such entity to these terms.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-2">2. Use of the Services</h3>
      <p>
        UnsignedFM grants you a personal, revocable, non-transferable,
        non-exclusive, limited license to use and access the Services solely as
        permitted by these Terms. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to
        you by these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except as permitted by these terms or otherwise permitted by us in
        writing, your license does not include the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise
          commercially exploit the Services or Content
        </li>
        <li>
          modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or
          reverse engineer any part of the Services or Content
        </li>
        <li>
          access the Services or Content in order to build a similar or
          competitive website, product, or service
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to suspend, modify, or discontinue the Services (in
        whole or in part) at any time, with or without notifying you. Any future
        release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Services will
        be subject to these Terms, which may be updated from time to time. You
        agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any
        suspension, modification, or discontinuation of the Services or any part
        thereof.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-2">3. Account Security</h3>
      <p>
        To use certain features of our Services, you may be required to create a
        UnsignedFM account (an "Account") and provide us with a username,
        password, email address, and certain other information about yourself as
        described in the <a routerLink="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> .
      </p>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for the information associated with your
        Account and anything that happens related to your Account. You must
        maintain the security of your Account and promptly notify UnsignedFM if
        you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Account without
        your permission. We recommend that you use a strong password that is
        used only with the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will not license, sell, or transfer your Account without our prior
        written consent.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-2">4. Your Content and Content Licensing</h3>
      <p>
        The Services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos,
        videos, or other materials (“Content”), including Content created with
        or submitted to the Services by you or through your Account (“Your
        Content”). We take no responsibility for and we do not expressly or
        implicitly endorse any of Your Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant
        that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the
        rights to Your Content contained within these Terms. Because you alone
        are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability
        if you post or share Content without all necessary rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant
        UnsignedFM the following license to use that Content:
      </p>
      <p><b>License to UnsignedFM</b></p>
      <p>
        When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you
        grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, transferable, and
        sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative
        works from, distribute, perform, and display Your Content in all media
        formats and channels now known or later developed. This license includes
        the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication,
        broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies,
        organizations, or individuals who partner with UnsignedFM.
      </p>
      <p><b>License Duration</b></p>
      <p>
        The license granted to us by you continue for a commercially reasonable
        period of time after you remove or delete your Content from the Service.
        You understand and agree that UnsignedFM may retain, but not display,
        distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been
        removed or deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we
        may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove Your Content at any time
        and for any reason, including for violating our
        <a routerLink="/content-policy">Content Policy</a> or these Terms, or if
        you otherwise create liability for us.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-2">5. Third-Party Content and Advertisements</h3>
      <p>
        The Services may contain links to third-party websites, products, or
        services, which may be posted by advertisers, our affiliates, our
        partners, or other users (“Third-Party Content”). Third-Party Content is
        not under our control, and we are not responsible for any of their
        websites, products, or services. Your use of Third-Party Content is at
        your own risk and you should make any investigation you feel necessary
        before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such
        Third-Party Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Services may also contain sponsored Third-Party Content or
        advertisements. The type, degree, and targeting of advertisements are
        subject to change, and you acknowledge and agree that we may place
        advertisements in connection with the display of any Content or
        information on the Services, including Your Content.
